    bio: 'Award-winning potter from Oaxaca, preserving ancient Zapotec techniques.',
    story: 'From a young age, I was mesmerized by the way my grandmother could turn a simple lump of clay into a beautiful, functional piece of art. She taught me the ancient Zapotec firing techniques that give our pottery its distinctive black sheen. Each piece I create is a conversation with my ancestors, a story told through earth and fire. My workshop is nestled in the valleys of Oaxaca, where the clay is rich with history and the air is filled with inspiration.',

    bio: 'Master of Japanese joinery, creating minimalist furniture that breathes.',
    story: 'In my small workshop in Kyoto, the scent of hinoki cypress fills the air. I practice kigumi, the art of joining wood without nails or screws. It is a philosophy of patience and precision. Each joint must be perfect, a seamless union that respects the life of the tree. My designs are inspired by the tranquility of Japanese gardens, aiming to bring a sense of peace and balance into the home.',

    bio: 'Textile artist from Kano, known for vibrant, modern indigo-dyed fabrics.',
    story: 'The art of indigo dyeing is a legacy passed down through generations of women in my family. We cultivate the indigo plants, harvest the leaves, and ferment them to create the magical blue dye. Using traditional resist-dyeing techniques called Adire, I create patterns that tell stories of our culture, our proverbs, and our connection to the natural world. Each cloth is a canvas of deep blue, a testament to a rich and vibrant heritage.',

    story: 'The heat of the furnace is where I feel most at home. On the island of Murano, my family has been blowing glass for over 500 years. I am a guardian of that flame. While I honor the classic Venetian techniquesâ€”the intricate murrine and delicate filigranaâ€”I push the boundaries with modern forms and bold colors. My work is a dance between fire and breath, tradition and innovation.',

My designs draw from Mughal architecture and the flora of Rajasthan. Each piece is a miniature painting, a story of color and light, meticulously handcrafted to be a timeless treasure.',

Using vegetable-tanned reindeer leather, a byproduct of our traditional herding, I create bags, belts, and pouches. Each item is hand-stitched and often embellished with patterns from our shaman drums, carrying the spirit of the Arctic with it.',
